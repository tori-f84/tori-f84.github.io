Handmade using hand-mined chrysoprase from Western Australia and stirling silver. Beautiful apple green colour, almost perfectly uniform colour with a small white speck - like a white horse on top of a wave. Stamped 925 and set in a backless setting so the light can shine through and really show off the stone. </p>\n"}

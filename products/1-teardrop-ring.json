Handmade using stirling silver and hand-mined chrysoprase from Western Australia. Beautiful apple green colour, almost perfectly uniform with a small white speck - like a white horse on top of a wave. Stamped <i>925</i> and set in a backless setting so the light can shine through and really show off the stone. </p>\n"}
